In the midst of a busy day, have you ever suddenly thought, "What am I even doing with my life?"

That's why I'm giving myself a small routine to make my daily life a little more 'vivid'.

This post is a collection of the "Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid" series that I have already posted on Threads.

I recorded it to come back and check whenever I need it, but I'm sharing it in case it might be helpful to you too.

Please read it with a light heart, just thinking,
"How does this person rest and relieve stress?"

Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid (1)

I think it takes a certain amount of effort to keep daily life vivid.

Just like washing your hands and brushing your teeth every day, a little effort is needed every day.

Meditation, exercise, reading, good sleep, journaling, reflection, walking, hobbies

These eight things are the core tools I try to do every day to polish my daily life.

I'll introduce them one by one...!!

Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid (2) - Meditation

'Meditation' is always mentioned in books about anxiety and the mind.

At first, I didn't know why people did it.

'Can the act of sitting still change my life?'

Daily life flows very quickly and complexly.
There are many times when it's hard to have a moment of peace.

For just 10 minutes a day, try to relax your body and mind.
Escape from past regrets or future anxieties

and focus on the 'now' and 'me'.

You'll feel that 10 minutes a day is more powerful than you think!

Are you not interested in meditation?

Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid (3) - Exercise

As a developer, I think exercise is an essential 'rest'.

When we think of resting, it's easy to think of lying down and watching YouTube or sleeping.

However, for developers who sit all day, I think 'exercise' is a good form of rest.

I like climbing, working out, and running.

After sitting for 8 hours, going outside and moving my body,

and doing the exercise I wanted to do without any thought or purpose
is quite enjoyable.

For those of you who sit in a chair for a long time, are you not interested in exercise?
Climbing is also a very good hobby?!

Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid (4) - Reading

Did you know that reading relieves stress...?

It is said that just 6 minutes of reading reduces it by 68%.

Actually, I don't know about that, I just like reading books.

Life becomes richer, and it's an active leisure activity.

Books in various fields such as essays, self-help, science, development, and philosophy can also be a source of new inspiration.

I think it's a beneficial habit in many ways.

Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid (5) - Good Sleep

"Getting at least 7 hours of good sleep."

This is the most important principle in my life.
No matter what happens, I try to stick to this one thing.

I set the lights to dim 1-2 hours before going to bed,
and take a magnesium supplement.

I prepare for bed by writing in my journal, organizing my day, and reflecting.

I still use my phone before bed,
but I sleep well.

Is there anyone who doesn't look at their phone before bed...?
Please share your secret...

Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid (6) - Journaling

The reason I write a journal is simple.
I want to record my precious daily life somewhere.

Do you know the fun of looking back at your journal
when it becomes a year old, or two years old...?

What I did a year ago,
what I thought, and what I worried about

There's a쏠쏠한 fun in it.

Also, I think this attitude of cherishing each day
makes the next day precious.

How long have you all been keeping a journal?

Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid (7) - Reflection

I look back on myself on a weekly and monthly basis.

I set simple goals for the week, month, year, and 5 years,
and I check them every week.

- What did I do this week?
- Am I on track with my goals?
- Is there a better way to do things?
- When was the best moment?

Every night, I write in my journal
and finish the day with a habit tracker note.

I remind myself of my monthly and weekly goals.

I also check if I have followed my small daily habits.

When daily reflections gather,
a clearer direction gradually appears.

I believe that if I walk one day at a time like that,
I will eventually arrive at my desired destination.

Habits to Make Daily Life Vivid (8) - Walking

I go for a walk after lunch.

Since I spend 90% of my working hours sitting,
I move my body to promote my health.

There is also the pleasant feeling that walking gives.
The joy of walking excitedly while listening to music is also good,
and it's the best for organizing a complicated mind.

If I go for a short walk during work,
my stress is significantly reduced
and my head feels clearer.

An evening walk after work is also a treat.

Feeling the cool and pleasant breeze,
there is the fun of seeing the various appearances of people.

During the day, there are many busy office workers,
but in the evening, you can see the stories of various people.

I believe that the way to make daily life 'vivid'
starts not from a grand change,

but from small daily choices and habits.

Some days I skip it because I'm lazy,
and sometimes I miss it because I'm busy.
But, I always come back to it.

Do you have your own routine
that makes your daily life vivid?

If you don't have one yet, try making one starting today.
You will surely find a resting routine that suits you.
