## üß† What is Task-Master?

> A **task management system** for AI-driven development with Claude, designed to work seamlessly with **Cursor AI**.
>
> [Task-Master Official Repository Description](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master?tab=readme-ov-file#task-master-)

Simply put, it's a tool that manages a project's TO-DOs.
The AI becomes the project's PM (Product Manager)!

And there might be a misunderstanding because it says "with Claude" above.

You can use other AIs.
You can even run it with a local AI using ollama...!

### ‚ùì Why should I use this?

Does a personal project really need a 'project task management system'?
**No, it doesn't.**

But, this guy doesn't just 'manage tasks'.
Its true potential comes out when used with 'Cursor'.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

For basic usage, it would be faster to refer to the [official github](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master).

There is a way to use it with MCP and a way to use it with CLI.

Officially, using it with MCP is recommended,
but personally, I prefer the CLI.

It's light and you can command it quickly,
and most of all, **it looks cool.**

Try displaying it like this in your terminal...
It really gets you pumped up.

## üîç Real-World Review: After Using It All Day

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

After trying it, the setup was the most difficult part, and the rest was simple.

There are two main things to set up.

1.  Set up AI API key
    1.  I used the GPT-4o model.
2.  Write a PRD
    1.  GPT wrote it for me.

Once you set it up like this, Task-Master will create a to-do list based on the written PRD.

### üìã Task Organization

As you can see in the picture above, it checks not only the to-do list but also the priority, complexity, etc.

And that's not all.

If you look closely at task 3, it organizes implementation details, test strategies, sub-tasks, etc.

But if it only organizes tasks in a fancy way,
there's no reason to use it.

We can do that better ourselves.

### ü§ù Combination with Cursor

The synergy is amazing when used with Cursor.

Once you organize your to-do list with Task-Master,
a folder called /tasks is created in the directory.

It contains the to-do list, its description, and detailed implementation considerations.

If you put this into **Cursor** and work on it, the code context understanding improves noticeably and the quality of suggestions also improves.

### üí∏ Cost

I used it for about half a day yesterday.
The API cost was $0.11 (150 won).

I don't know what you'll think,
but from my experience, it seems like a reasonable price.

It manages my to-do list,
and it also upgrades Cursor's efficiency.

### üß© Pro Tip

Personally, I found it annoying to type task-master every time I entered a command.

```bash
task-master set-status ~~
```

So I made it shorter by creating an alias.

```bash
tm set-status ~~
```

A micro-tip.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Pros and Cons Summary

### ‚úÖ Pros

- Automated task distribution
  - Just input the PRD and it automatically organizes priority, complexity, and sub-tasks
  - Fast and efficient task distribution possible
- Synergy with Cursor
  - Putting the generated tasks into Cursor greatly improves code context understanding
  - Improves both code quality and work speed
- Convenient CLI usage
  - If you are familiar with the CLI environment, you can command it lightly and quickly
  - Repetitive use can also be simplified with alias settings
- Reasonable cost
  - Based on GPT-4o, about $0.1 (150 won) for half a day of use
  - Very cheap for its functionality

### ‚úÖ Cons

- Entry barrier of initial setup
  - Initial setup such as API key registration and PRD preparation can feel somewhat difficult if you are not familiar with it
- Burden of writing a PRD
  - If you have to write the PRD yourself, it can take time and money
  - I also generated the PRD with GPT, but it doesn't mean that planning skills are not necessary
- Performance varies depending on input quality
  - The generated tasks depend heavily on the quality of the PRD
  - In other words, the basic limitation of AI tools, "good input ‚Üí good output", exists

## ‚ú® Surviving in a World Where New Things Keep Coming Out

These days, new things appear in the IT world every day.
AI, Cursor, MCP... it's so fast that it's hard to keep up.

From the perspective of working in a collaborative environment,
it's not easy to introduce and experiment with all of these things in real time.

Because there is not enough time.

In the end, I tend to try one or two new tools every time I do a toy project.

This time, I tried two tools, MCP and Task-Master.
I think they are useful tools, although not as big of a deal as I thought.

I don't think it's necessary to follow all of these things,
and I think it's fine to learn them when you need them.

My digression has been long.

Let me summarize briefly.

## üëÄ In Conclusion

To be honest, I'm still not sure about MCP.
I also tried using Task-Master in the MCP way, but

I found it faster and more intuitive to command it directly with the CLI
than to set up MCP, command it with natural language, and wait for the results.

I also handled the supabase MCP directly for a similar reason.

But Task-Master was a good find.
Considering the combination with Cursor and the cost-effectiveness,
it was a really reasonable tool.

I plan to finish this project with Task-Master.

I recommend you all try it out at least once!

And I'm also curious about your thoughts on MCP.
Am I just not using it right...?

If there's anyone who uses it well, please leave a comment.

Additionally, when I posted a similar question on Threads,
I received a good answer about MCP, so I'm sharing it here!!

I think it would be helpful to refer to it!
