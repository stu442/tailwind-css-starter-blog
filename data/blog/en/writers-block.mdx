I made a blog and thought, 'I should write one article a week.'

Sometimes I wonder what to write about today.
(Today is one of those days.)

I have my own philosophy for choosing a topic for an article.
To put it simply,

> I think an article that only conveys information has little value.
> Information has already become so cheap.
>
> If you ask GPT, you can get the information you want in about a minute.

I decided to write articles that are as unique as possible.

Personal worries, thoughts, things I feltâ€¦

Not everyone may be able to relate, but
I think an article that can at least reach someone is good.

So for this article, I'm going to introduce the factors I consider when I write.

I've already introduced many of them on Threads, but

I thought it was necessary to elaborate on them in a long article.

The writing process can be broadly divided into

> Planning - Writing - Reflecting - Publishing

It goes through these 4 stages.

### Planning

This is the stage where you decide on a topic to write about and create a simple table of contents and the form of the article.

Actually, I tend to just write furiously as soon as I decide on a topic.

I usually start with the most personal things as topics.

Because I think that is the most unique and original topic.

[An article reflecting on what I learned after getting interested in Go and studying it](https://frogsoo.vercel.app/blog/cute-go),
[An article about experimenting with my long-held dream of coding anywhere](https://frogsoo.vercel.app/blog/home-ssh),
[A retrospective article left during my vacation after finishing a big project](https://frogsoo.vercel.app/blog/10-good-dev)

These are some examples.

It looks easy this way, but there are several criteria when choosing a topic.
I'm using what I saw in a book called "Editorial Writing" to suit my needs.

- Timeliness: Is there a reason for the reader to read this right now?
- Originality: Is there any special information? If not, is there a story of my own?
- Value: What can the reader get from reading this article?

These are the three things.

I usually don't do the process of creating a table of contents or the form of the article.

Personally, I don't find it fun and it's difficult.
But if you can handle these things, you can become a great writer, right??

I tend to just write and then clean up the mess when I reflect.

### Writing

Writing is not very difficult.

Because I started with a personal topic, I have a lot to write about.
I just have to pour out the words inside me.

Therefore, what I think is important is
'not to suppress'.

You really have to just write freely.
I don't self-censor.
I think writing is more in the realm of intuition than reason.

I write without caring if the spacing is wrong, if it gets too long, or if it's too short.
**I fix it during the reflection process.**

### Reflection

Now it's time to clean up the mess.

If you've come this far, you can see 'something' in the form of an article.

The grammar and spacing are all over the place,
and there may be monologues, too personal sentences, or inappropriate words.

This is a natural phenomenon.

Now it's time to filter it out.

First, I structure the article.
I consider three principles to be important.

- One message per article
- One argument per paragraph
- One predicate per sentence

If a sentence has multiple subjects and predicates mixed in,
it becomes difficult for the reader to follow.
So I prefer short sentences.

Paragraphs are the same.
If you put several stories in one paragraph,
the main point becomes blurred and it becomes difficult to read.

The whole article is the same.
Don't try to put too many messages in it.
The reader will only remember one feeling, one insight.

Once you've finished editing, try reading it out loud.

This will help you to know the rhythm of the article,
and you can catch any unnatural parts.

And if possible, try reading it again after a day or so.

When you read it again after some time has passed,
you can see parts that need to be fixed.

Once you've done this, the last thing you do is a spell check.
I do it on Naver.

### Publishing

Actually, I think the more you reflect, the better the article will be.

Of course, if you keep holding on to the article and don't publish it,
it will be an article that no one reads.

That's why I think deadlines are important.

> The reflection process should not exceed 3 days, and publishing should be done within 7 days.

This is my standard.

## Conclusion

If you've read this far, you'll know that
I tend to just write freely.

If a brilliant topic comes to mind, I tend to write it down first.

An idea has no value when it's in your head.

It gains value when you take it out and show it to the world.

Do you know Leonardo da Vinci?
It is said that over 5,000 pages of da Vinci's notes have been passed down to this day.

It is also said that not all of his achievements were original.

He constantly observed, copied, and broke down his thoughts into notes.
He chose to leave ten incomplete lines rather than one perfect line.

Thanks to him, we can get a glimpse of da Vinci's thoughts, experiments,
and even his unfinished ideas.

If an idea comes to mind, let's write it down first.
Take a memo. Don't let it flow away.
Leave it, even if it's incomplete.

Even the notes that you thought were strange,
can become material for an article after some time has passed,
and can grow into a great article.

So, just give writing a try.
