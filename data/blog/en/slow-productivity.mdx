# Go Slower

Do you want to be efficient?
Then you should also consider going slower.

### We want to go faster.

People who want to be efficient mostly want to do more things, more varied things.

However, we cannot handle many things at once.

### Multitasking is a myth.

'Multitasking', doing several things at the same time, may seem efficient.

But I think that if you do several things at the same time, you will end up not completing any of them.

In fact, humans are not optimized for multitasking.
We are just **'switching'** between several things very quickly.

Switching comes at a price.
We call it the **'context switching cost (task switching cost)**'.

When you switch from email to a meeting, it takes time to get your head straight.

Then, if a messenger notification comes, you look at the messenger again, and another cost is incurred.

[According to this article](https://www.larksuite.com/ko_kr/blog/context-switching), this switching cost is about 20 minutes.

We think we are switching tasks in an instant, but for 20 minutes after the switch, we are in a state where we cannot concentrate on any task.

The repetition of this 'switching' lowers efficiency and makes you tired easily.

### Go Slower

Therefore, to go faster, I think we need to build up slowly but surely.

And one of the concepts that helps with that is "Deep Work".

> Summary: The faster you want to go, the slower and more deeply you need to concentrate.
> Multitasking is just an illusion; our brains can only properly immerse themselves in one thing at a time.

## Deep Work

This is a concept presented in Cal Newport's book "Deep Work".

What I think of as deep work is as follows:

- Plan your immersion time and tasks in advance
  - Plan what you will do for 1-2 hours a day in advance.
- Remove all distractions
  - Block your phone and all notifications.
- Don't multitask
  - Never multitask during deep work time.

And you do this every day.

To put it simply in one sentence, it is this.

> Deep work: Concentrate for 1-2 hours every day without being disturbed, and devote yourself only to that.

### Securing 1-2 hours a day

I wake up at 6:30 am every day.
Since I go to work at 8 am, I have about 1 hour left, excluding preparation time.

I write during that time.

The morning time was the most appropriate.
It's a quiet time when no one contacts me.
I turn off notifications, put my phone out of sight, and work.

### What kind of work should I choose?

1 hour can be a short time.
So you need to do the "most impactful work".

I thought that was 'writing',
but for you, it could be something else.

Exercise, video editing, coding, studying...
Anything is fine.

Choose the 1-2 most impactful tasks and start your deep work!

## Pareto Principle

Let me talk a little more about impact.

I think one of the most important things when going slow is 'what to devote yourself to'.

This principle, named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, means that

> 80% of the total results come from 20% of the total causes.

Conversely, it means that a very core 20% of the work can produce 80% of the results.

You need to find what that work is.
That work that has the greatest impact on your life.

In a limited amount of time, priority is very important.

I thought that reading and writing were the most core tasks.

And I do that work for 1 hour every morning.

Think about what the single most important thing in your life is.

## Every day, for a long time, with compound interest

I think the important keywords are "every day, for a long time".

Doing the same thing a little bit every day, for a long time, can have a huge effect.

And if that work is a very "core" work.

Let's say you invest 10,000 won and get a 10% annual return.
If you earn 10% in the first year, you will have 11,000 won at the end of the year.

The next year it will be 12,100 won, and the year after that it will be 13,300 won.

If it increases by 30% compounded for 30 years, the money will increase not by 10 or 20 times, but by thousands of times.

The concept of compound interest does not only apply to money.
You can also apply compound interest to your life.

Work that grows steadily and for a long time can never be ignored.

## Slowly but surely

Now what you have to do is clear.

1. Find the work that will have the greatest impact on my life
2. Make time to do it for 1-2 hours every day
3. Do it

You can achieve excellent results by repeating it every day, slowly but surely.
