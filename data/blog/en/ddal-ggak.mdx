The reason I first started studying development was because I wanted to automate the consignment sales process I was doing as a side job for pocket money in college.
I didn't want to do simple repetitive tasks every day.

> ‘I make the tools I need in the form that is best for me to use.’

That thought still holds true.

## It's tough for a recent graduate....

As a recent graduate, living with monthly expenses of 600,000 won is a very difficult situation.

For people like you, the country has various measures for 'youth'.

First, there is the 'Youth Monthly Rent Support' that most young people will know about.
It's a policy that supports up to 200,000 won per month for one year, once in a lifetime.

I have applied for it this time. Hoho...

And there is also a system called 'Youth Public Rental Housing' that many people surprisingly don't know about.

Simply put, you can think of it as a system where the state provides low-cost rental housing to solve housing costs cheaply.

## However...

However, there is a problem.

First of all, the competition is no joke.

As many young people in Korea work in Seoul, many people are looking for stable housing in Seoul.

But there's nothing we can do about that.

The biggest problem is that 'applying' is difficult.
Every week, you have to go to the website to check if a new announcement has been posted.

This was so annoying.

## "Check" it for me

So I thought it would be good to automate this too.

Using Github Actions, it checks if a new post has been written on the desired web page every day, and if so, it notifies me via Telegram.

## Technology Selection

I started by thinking about the language.
I suddenly remembered that I had used Go for crawling in the past.

I found Go to be quite fun, so I chose Go to study as well.

However, since I was planning to do most of the work using Claude Code, it didn't really matter...

I wanted to use Github Action's Cron Job to send a notification to my phone via the Telegram Bot API every day at 9 am.

## Claude's Sword Dance

Since I had a rough plan, I just gave Claude a rough order.

Then it started working on its own, and in about 30 minutes, it had created all the code.

Although there were many things I had to do outside of the code, like setting up Github Actions and the Telegram bot, thanks to Claude Code's perfect code, I was able to complete the system I aimed for in just one hour.

## The Easiest Era to Make Your Own Tools

Now, making the tools you need and that are right for you has become a piece of cake...

The old me who struggled to automate the consignment sales process became a developer like this, but now, to make a tool, you can just give a command with a 'prompt' without much thought.

It's a really convenient world, but I think there are definitely many things that have been lost.

The opportunity for deep and solid growth that could be obtained by directly confronting and struggling with problems.

As a developer, I have many thoughts.

I'll go study some more.
Thank you for reading.
