## I want to do an experiment. üß™

Tools that explosively increase development productivity, such as Vibe Coding, AI, and MCP, are pouring out every day.

However, for me, working in a closed network environment, the opportunity to try these tools myself was rare.

On the other hand, I had a desire to experiment by creating 'my own product'.

Although I have experience with a toy project that actually acquired users,

"How many users can an app made quickly and lightly with AI gather?"
I wanted to test that possibility.

So, for 30 days, I'm starting an experiment where I do everything from planning to development and marketing myself.
By the end of June, through this journey, I intend to cultivate a sense for products.

## A Space in Daegu ü™ü

![](/static/images/two-app/1.png)

The beginning was a certain space in Daegu.
It's a space where you can quietly do various things while enjoying contemplation.

There are many books, you can draw, drink tea, or just sit quietly and feel the atmosphere.

What was most impressive here was the 'guestbook'.

To be precise, it was a concept closer to a 'shared note'.

Everyone who visited this space wrote their thoughts, feelings, emotions, and daily diaries in this note.

At that time, I was exhausted from being overwhelmed with many things.
That space and the 'shared note' were a great comfort to me.

I was comforted by reading other people's stories, and writing my own story in a note that someone else might see was also a great comfort.

It was a healing moment.

I thought it would be great if people who are struggling now could have this experience.
So I decided I had to make this service.

## Dancing with GPT

At first, I just thought, 'I should try to implement a `shared note` on the web!'

But I wanted to be thorough with the planning.
Having done many toy projects on my own, I realized the importance of a solid plan...

So I started planning with GPT.

I talked with GPT about the features I was thinking of, and we discussed what other features might be needed and which ones to remove.

And when I asked it to organize everything, a decent plan came out!

With these plans, I started working on the design, wireframe, and data structure with GPT again, and I organized a lot of documents.

Very reassuring..

From planning, data structure, API design, design, prompts, personas, wireframes...

Everything needed for the service, from planning to design, feature design, and development, was designed in just one day...!!

It's a truly wonderful world.

## Design? AI did it for me. üé®

However, what GPT generated was just text, and I had to do the implementation.

I wanted to quickly launch a service with minimal features.
If I were to do the design and development that fit the plan on my own, it would take at least a week.

But, it's different with AI.
You can quickly produce a product of a certain guaranteed quality.

Friends who can create code just by looking at design and planning text already exist.

The services I know of are Lovable, bolt.new, and v0.
I decided to try making something rough with all three for free.

### Lovable

### bolt.new

### v0

I used the same prompt for all of them.
So similar designs came out.

Among them, I liked the design of bolt.new.
It used framer motion to implement small animations.

I finished the simple design and implementation with AI.
However, I had to do the detailed implementation myself, such as linking with the backend and the GPT scheduler.

But do I really have to do it myself?
I entrusted the major tasks to AI with MCP and Cursor.

About 80% of the detailed implementation work was not done by me.
I had AI do it all.

When I combined MCP and Cursor, it implemented the requirements quite accurately.

## Implementation... AI did it for me too. üõ†Ô∏è

### The PM that became, MCP: Task-Master üìã

Among them, the most impressive MCP server is Task-Master.
I have already written a [post](https://velog.io/@stu442/PM-%EC%97%86%EC%9D%B4-%ED%98%BC%EC%9E%90-%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%ED%95%9C%EB%8B%A4%EA%B3%A0%EC%9A%94-%EC%A0%80%EB%8A%94-AI-PM-%EC%94%81%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4) about it, so I will only introduce it briefly.

Task-Master takes a PRD (Product Requirements Document) and organizes the major tasks, detailed tasks, and implementation details based on the PRD.

And when you work on a task using Task-Master in Cursor, the AI writes code based on the already created `to-do list` and `plan`.

Since all the context is already written, you can get a pretty good implementation just by "clicking" "~ implement this" without a detailed explanation.

And it adds and modifies tasks on its own.

### Lightweight Backend, Supabase üß±

I used Supabase for the backend.

I chose Supabase because I was familiar with it and wanted to try using an MCP Server.

Moreover, the DX (Developer Experience) is also quite good.

I thought this stack was the most appropriate for quickly experimenting with a product.

Based on the API definition and data structure I had already created, I created a DB and conducted tests.

## A Small Healing Space Made in Two Days ‚ú®

Many intermediate steps were omitted, but in any case, a product with minimal functionality was born.

It took about 2 days.

It was 2 days where I felt that you can quickly get a decent experimental product for a simple CRUD web app using AI.

From now on, for about 30 days, I plan to post content on SNS and try to induce people's participation.

I plan to record this process on my blog as well, and the web page has Vercel's Analytics function.

I can check visitor and referrer information.

For now, it's a space that only I visit...

If you have any good promotion methods, please share... them.

If you are interested, you might want to try it out.

Personally, I wanted to experiment with how many users an app made quickly with a light idea could gather.

At the same time, it is my own small challenge to cultivate a sense for products.

I would be grateful if you would watch this journey that will continue for the next month. üôè
