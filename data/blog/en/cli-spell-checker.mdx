I tend to write almost every day.

Since I write for others to see,
'spell checking' is essential.

The process of opening a browser
and finding a spell checker every day
was so annoying.

But I found the perfect tool.

## hanspell

[hanspell](https://github.com/9beach/hanspell) is a Korean spell checker that uses the web services of Daum and Pusan National University's Artificial Intelligence Lab / Narainfotech, Inc.

A major advantage is that it can be run from the CLI.

I use it with an alias.

```shell
$ alias spell-check="pbpaste | hanspell-cli"
```

> pbpaste | hanspell-cli -> Corrects the sentence copied to the clipboard in a Mac environment.

Now, I can copy with cmd + c,
open the terminal, and type the command "spell-check" to correct the sentence.
