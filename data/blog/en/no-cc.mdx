## A Lesson from a Toy Project: Source Code 'Ownership'

A project that started with 'Let's just build something simple~' gradually grew, and I ended up spending the whole day refactoring today.

What I felt during this process was one thing.
It's the ownership of the source code.

No matter how well AI writes code,
it is the developer who ultimately understands, selects, and takes responsibility for that code.

What role this function plays

Where it is located in the overall code

You must be able to explain it yourself.
Otherwise, 'code I don't know' accumulates,
and eventually leads to technical debt.

AI is a powerful tool that speeds up development,
but **the ownership always belongs to the developer.**
