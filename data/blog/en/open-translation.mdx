## todo.txt

Recently, I discovered an [open-source repository](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) that organizes and introduces how to manage a to-do list in plain text.

I was going to share it while writing a related post on my blog, but I thought people wouldn't read it well because the README.md was in English.

So I decided to add a translation myself.

## Let's start translating.

The content of the README was actually very easy and simple.
I thought it would be the 'right size' for my first translation contribution.

First, I had Gemini CLI do the entire translation, and then I approached it by correcting the awkward parts myself.

At first, I thought it would be over quickly.
However, once I actually did it, it wasn't as easy as I thought.

## Pondering over a single word, craftsmanship

For example, the word _context_ was translated literally as '컨텍스트'.
It's faithful to the original text, but I thought '맥락' or '상황' would be more natural for a first-time reader.

I also 고민ed a lot about how to translate plain text, and which word between '작업' and '할 일' would be more natural.

If you leave the original text as it is, it's uncomfortable to read, and if you translate it freely, it moves away from the original text.

The biggest challenge was finding a balance between the two.

## What I learned from translating

In the end, I felt that translation is also a kind of creation.
It's not just about moving sentences,

but about finding expressions that can preserve the intention of the original text while being well understood by the reader and reaching them.

The key was finding the middle ground between "original text and readability".

## Going forward

I have now finished the translation and have submitted a PR.
I'm looking forward to seeing if this contribution will be accepted or if I will receive feedback.

Through this experience, I learned that even a small translation contribution can be meaningful.
I plan to continue translating interesting repositories in the future.

It was more fun and a better experience than I thought.
