## Overview

Thanks to AI, you can develop lightly anytime, anywhere.
Just type a prompt and it will create a prototype for you.

So I thought about it.
If it's an environment where you can really just type a prompt anywhere,
wouldn't it be possible to develop somehow?

So I tried using SSH to remotely access my computer from my phone.

## Port Forwarding

The first thing that came to mind was port forwarding.

It's a way to open a specific port on my network to the outside.

However, this method is also critical for security,
and it took too much effort to worry about these things.

## The Fastest Way, Tailscale

Tailscale is a modern VPN solution that allows you to easily and securely connect multiple devices without complex settings.

If you install this program and turn on the VPN,
you can connect to each other via VPN.

This method was the most suitable for me.

I could apply it quickly and didn't have to worry much about security.
Plus, you can use it sufficiently with the **free plan**.

## Connecting via SSH

### Installing Tailscale

Now the method is very easy.

Install Tailscale on the device you want to connect to,
and turn on the VPN.

In my case, it was a Mac mini, iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.

I set it up so that I can access my Mac mini anytime with my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.

### Mac mini Settings

Select System Settings > General > Sharing menu.

Activate "Remote Login" and you're all set.

### Connecting with iPhone, iPad

There are several ways to connect via SSH with an iPhone or iPad.

There is a way to connect with a terminal,
and a way to connect with an editor.

For the terminal, I used an app called Termius,
and for the editor, I used a paid app called Code.

Both apps are intuitive to use,
so I will omit detailed explanations in this article and talk about them lightly.

It will ask for a user name and IP address for SSH connection.

For the user name, enter the user name of the Mac mini,
and for the IP address, enter the IP address of the Mac mini written in Tailscale and connect.

## Utilization with AI

After setting it up and connecting like this,
I was really able to remotely access my computer from outside!!

I could check server logs on my iPhone on my way to work,
or make simple code modifications on my iPad,
and do various other things.

However, what I wanted to do most was development.
The romance of being able to develop with AI from anywhere.

I can't use Cursor,
but Gemini CLI and Claude Code work in a CLI environment.

They are very suitable for use in an SSH environment.

Is it really possible to code with AI on your phone on your way to and from work?
I plan to test it myself.

I'll share that experience in the next post!!
