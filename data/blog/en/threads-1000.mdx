## Connecting with 1,000 People, Something I Never Imagined

Gathering 1,000 people with my writing was something I truly never imagined.

I wasn't originally a person who was close to writing.
Until middle school, the only books I had read were textbooks and workbooks,
and writing was always something I wanted to avoid.

I had to use my brain a lot, and I didn't want to go out of my way to do something difficult.

If I had told my past self, 'You will connect with 1,000 people through your writing!'
I would never have believed it.

But now, I have connected with 1,000 people through my writing.

The final goal I set when I started Threads was "1,000 followers",
and it has finally been achieved.

## New Experiences I Met Through Writing

Actually, I have created content before Threads.
I liked music, so I ran a blog and an Instagram account.

But at that time, I was just borrowing the theme of "music",
I didn't fully put "myself" forward as the content.

It was different on Threads.
The theme of the writing was "me", and thanks to that, my thoughts and experiences were conveyed more directly.

In the process, a lot of different things happened.

- I had enjoyable conversations through coffee chats
- I joined a community and discussed projects.
- Sometimes, people asked for career counseling.

All of these experiences were special to me.

Because I deeply felt that "writing" is not just about recording or expressing,
but a medium that connects people.

## The Meaning of Writing

The number 1,000 is not just a follower count,
but a turning point that changed the direction of my life.

Through writing, I was able to "organize myself",
"understand my thoughts more deeply", and at the same time, "connect with people".

I have already achieved my goal, but I will not stop writing in the future.
Because writing has been a great help to my growth and has made my life richer.
(And if I write a little more, I can also set a record of writing for 30 consecutive days...! ü§£)

## Future Plans

Recently, I have been focusing on writing on Threads,
but now I want to consistently share my thoughts and learnings on LinkedIn and my blog as well.
Just as writing has helped me grow, I hope that someday my records will be helpful to someone else.

## In Conclusion

Being able to connect with 1,000 people is all thanks to everyone who read, reacted to, and talked about my writing.
Thank you so much. üôè

I will continue to share my stories in this space.
Please look forward to it!
