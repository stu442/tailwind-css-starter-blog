It has been 10 months since I started working as a front-end developer.
After finishing a demanding project, I received a two-week vacation.

I want to take this opportunity to think about what makes a 'good front-end developer.'

I felt the need while updating my resume,
and I thought it was necessary to contemplate the direction I should take moving forward.

## The Past 10 Months

### Before Getting a Job

As a 4th-year economics major, I had many concerns about my career path, just like any other graduating university student.

I had been coding as a hobby, and that came to mind.
So, I decided I should get a job as a web developer.

After making the decision, I worked on personal projects
and sent out a huge number of resumes.

In June 2024, I joined a company as a front-end developer.

### The 10 Months After Getting a Job

As soon as I joined, I was put on a small project.
Since then, including JavaScript which every web developer encounters,
I have used Flutter, Python, Java, C#, etc., to solve various problems required by the company.

Although I came in as a front-end developer and experienced UI development,
most of the time, I solved problems unrelated to the user interface.

Tasks like crawling, API development, and creating simple conversion programs.

During this process, I had many doubts and felt a sense of skepticism.
'I came in as a front-end developer, is this right?'

I felt that if things continued this way, I would become a developer with no depth, mediocre at both front-end and back-end development.

Of course, in the process of solving various problems,
I learned a lot by experiencing back-end development, communication, and more.

Nevertheless, my doubts about my direction continued.
I want to take this opportunity to think about and organize my thoughts on what a 'good developer' is.

## Front-End Developer?

A web front-end developer is responsible for developing the 'screen' that the user sees.

However, I don't think a developer who can 'only' do UI development is a good developer.
Anyone can become that kind of developer. They are easily replaceable.

The term UI development implies more elements than one might think.

## My Thoughts on UI Development

### Understanding the Domain

If you're new to a domain, every term can be confusing.
There will be many words that make you think, 'What is this...?'

That's why understanding and studying the domain is essential.

### Ability to Understand the Plan

Understanding the domain helps with the 'ability to understand the plan.'

Learning domain terminology and deeply understanding the domain helps in grasping the essence.
You can understand the role of the screen you are in charge of and what the user wants.

This ability allows for active communication with planners and designers.
You can identify the core of the problem and create a better product.

### Responding to Rapid Changes

The user interface changes incredibly fast and frequently.

It's common for plans to change or designs to be completely overturned.
It could be a change in the UI or a change in the logic.

The ability to handle these changes quickly and accurately is also important.

Ultimately, you need the ability to write good, flexible code that can adapt to change.

## Code Writing Ability

The ability to write 'good code' is one of the most important competencies for a software developer.
Front-end is no exception.

I always think about good code.
I have to consider whether the code I'm writing is advantageous for 'change'
and whether there will be any 'performance' issues.

Besides this, there are many other things to consider, such as error handling, clean code, comments, and collaboration.
You must always strive to write code you are not ashamed of.

## Continuous Learning Ability

Front-end development trends change rapidly.
AI tools are also constantly emerging.

So, should we follow all these changes?
No.

I believe we shouldn't be dragged along by change.

Ultimately, the basics come first.
A solid foundation makes it easier to respond to change and enables rapid growth.

The basis of all web frameworks is HTML, CSS, and JS.
As a web developer, understanding the web is also essential.

You need to know how to debug, especially how to use developer tools well.
Developer tools can do more than you think.

I think having a curious attitude is important.
If you're curious about something, it's good to look it up and try it out.

You can study it when it becomes necessary,
or try applying it to a toy project.

## Other Things

### I can read Spring code to some extent!

Participating in a project required me to develop and maintain the server.
Thanks to that, I gained some basic infrastructure knowledge, including Spring.

Even without knowledge of the Java language, it's easy to understand if you've used TypeScript.
Personally, implementing a simple API with Spring was a great help.

When you implement an API, it becomes easier to communicate with back-end developers.

Originally, I was afraid to make requests to back-end developers.
This was because I couldn't predict how long it would take or how difficult it would be.

But once I had some knowledge, I could make predictions.

You can confidently request what you need and solve problems quickly.
'Can you give me this API response in a different format?'
Things like that.

### Product Sense

I recommend doing personal/toy projects.
If possible, I think it's good to experience the entire process from planning to design, deployment, and marketing.

You can practice thinking from a user-centric perspective.
It's said that front-end developers are closest to the user.

Moreover, front-end developers have many opportunities to communicate with various people,
such as designers, planners, and back-end developers.

I believe the confidence and ability to communicate actively
depend on 'product sense.'

### Soft Skills

I wrote 'soft skills' to keep it brief,
but I think they are really important.

The experience of thinking about the following has been a great help.

- Craftsmanship
- Agile
- TDD / Test Code
- Clean Code
- Refactoring
- Code Quality
- Pragmatism

## So What?

I've rambled on.
I've talked about many things, but this is the core.

'The ability to understand and solve complex business problems'
'The ability to collaborate with various people and actively solve problems'

In the end, it's all about 'problem-solving.'

And for this, I don't think getting bogged down in a specific language or technology is very meaningful.
Ultimately, isn't it good if the 'problem' is solved appropriately?

## Finally

Before becoming a good front-end developer, you must become a good developer.
A good developer can understand and solve complex business problems.

They can solve problems without being dependent on a specific technology or language,
and through this, they can contribute to the business and the user.

### What Kind of Developer Will I Become?

In the future, I want to be a more proactive developer.
With a sense of craftsmanship, I will strive to create better products.
I want to communicate more actively and be the one who discovers problems first.

This is not just a code issue.
Personally, I felt I lacked passion for the company I'm currently working at.

So, I organized a simple study group.

Once a week,
we gather for about an hour to study.

I'm trying to inject some passion into the organization.
I hope that at least while I'm here, we can become a more passionate team.

I want to expand a better development culture and passion not only within the company but throughout the industry.

I plan to write good articles,
and also utilize the [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@dev_frogsoo) account I currently run.

I intend to meet and grow with many people through coffee chats.
I also plan to create opportunities for networking by holding weekly coding sessions.

I will also be posting a retrospective on my external activities related to this soon.
Thank you for reading this long post.
Thank you.
