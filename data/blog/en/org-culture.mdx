Although I haven't seen many, I've noticed something while observing several organizations.

Organizational culture and the output that the organization produces are strongly connected.

A good culture creates good output.

Organizational culture is not just about the ‘working atmosphere’.
It describes the characteristics of the output that the organization produces.

- A culture that emphasizes fast execution → MVP and endless experimentation
- A perfectionist culture → Results with attention to detail

Conversely, a bad culture is also reflected in the results.

- A team full of distrust and politics → Inefficiency and slow decision-making
- A team with only top-down instructions → Passive process, meaningless results
- A team with only pressure → Hastily written code, accumulating debt

Ultimately, an organization's products and services show the culture of that organization as it is.

I believe that culture is the color and characteristic of the output.

What about your organization?
What characteristics do you feel it has?

I have a great interest in organizational culture these days.
