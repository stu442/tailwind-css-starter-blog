## The Anxiety of Modern People

We are always in pain.
It is difficult to concentrate on any one thing because we live in anxiety and worry.

Life seems to get more complicated as time goes by.

After working at a company for a year, I suddenly had these thoughts.
The future was uncertain, and I felt like I hadn't accomplished anything so far.
It seemed like only work and responsibility were increasing with time.

Then I came across a sentence.

> Some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us.
>
> - Epictetus

This is a sentence from the Stoic philosopher, Epictetus.

Stoic philosophy has taught me a lot.
So I plan to share this insight slowly.

## Why are we anxious?

I thought about the cause of anxiety.

- 'What does the company, my colleagues think of me?',
- 'Am I not doing well enough?',
- 'If I continue like this, I won't be able to change jobs...?',
- 'What if this industry collapses due to AI....?'

These were my concerns about my career, future, and industry.

Come to think of it, these are all
'things I cannot control'.

Unless you hypnotize them, the perception of 'me' that people at the company have
cannot be 100% controlled. You can't even know it.

Concerns about the future are the same.
You cannot create a '100%' certain future.

Trying to change them and getting frustrated because you can't
is meaningless.

You need to think about what you can control.

- 'How can I spend today more fruitfully?'
- 'What attitude should I have towards my work?'
- 'What should I study and how should I grow?'
- 'How should I view the world?'

These are all things that I can 100% choose and control.
In the end, only my attitude, judgment, choices, and actions are the elements I can control.

## Only on what I can control,

After thinking like this, I let go a little.

Regardless of what the company thought, I did my best at what I had to do now.
I didn't worry about the future and paid attention to my energy distribution for the day.

My mind became lighter, and I was able to do my work better.

Of course, I still have anxious and sometimes stumbling days,
but now it is clear what I need to focus on.

It is to think about and act on what I can control.

Life has become simpler.

## Try it now

You probably have various worries and anxieties too.

How about thinking about what you can control?

1. Write down your worries on a piece of paper and divide them into 'controllable / uncontrollable'
2. Erase the things you can't control and pour your energy only into the things you can control
3. Whenever you feel anxious, ask yourself, "Is this something I can change?"

Life will become clearer and simpler.
